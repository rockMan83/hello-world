Intro to Github

I'm currently furloughed from my digital media job at Disney.  As a result I'm looking for another means of income and programming/app development seems to be a field that is expanding and a good fit for my personality type.  I really hope that I can find work soon as the pandemic is starting to take it's tole financially.  I have about 3 more months of savings and retirement before I'll have to take a loan or possibly go work as a courier/delivery man or even worse at fast food.  What a strange and scary time this is.
